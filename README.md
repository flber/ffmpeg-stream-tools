# ffstream

A simple (or not-so-simple in the case of the `extra/` directory) set of tools to screen capture and stream using ffmpeg.
For a more experimental set of applications, the `extra/` directory has scripts which are very unstable but perhaps interesting for those interested in more niche usecases (the purpose of everything there should be decently documented, but for details on implementation specifics please just send me an email while I work on better documentation!).

The goal for the main directory is to provide a couple of tools which should Just Work* though for the moment they're limited to usage on linux.

*which in this case means: will work with, ideally, under half an hour of debugging :)
